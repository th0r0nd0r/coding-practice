# Templates
- where frontend rendering happens (if not using a frontent framework like React)
- analogous to Views in Rails

### Setup
- generally live inside an app
- create a templates folder inside app
- create a sub-folder with the name of the template (this helps prevent name conflicts)
- file extension is just .html
