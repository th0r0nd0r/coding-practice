# Binary Trees

## General Properties

- each node has at most 2 children

#### Strict Binary Tree
- each node can have 0 or 2 children

#### Complete Binary Tree
- all levels except (maybe) last are filled
- unfilled nodes are as far left as possible

#### Perfect Binary Tree
- every level totally filled

#### Node Levels/Height
- first node is at level 0
- height of tree = # of edges
- max # of nodes at level i = 2^i
