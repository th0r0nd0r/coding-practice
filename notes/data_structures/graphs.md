# Graphs

### Definition

"A nonempty finite set of vertices **V** along with a set **E** of 2-element subsets of V. The elements of V are called vertices. The elements of E are called edges."

TL;DR- vertices connected by edges.

Ex:
- V: {V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6}
- E: {{V1,V2},{V1,V3},{V1,V4},{V4,V5},{V5,V6}}

### Terminology

- **Cardinality:** number of vertices in a graph
- **Degree** of a vertex Vn: number of edges connected to Vn
