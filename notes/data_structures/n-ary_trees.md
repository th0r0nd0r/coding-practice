# N-ary Trees
- pretty sure you pronounce it *en-airy*, not *en-areee*, like binary but with n instead of bi

### What are They?
- rooted trees where each node can have no more than n children
- Binary trees and tries are 2 examples of n-ary trees

### Traversal
- Binary Trees can have preorder, inorder, postorder and level order traversal
- all of these work for n-ary trees, except inorder (how would you decide when to print the current node?)
