# Trees

### Why use trees?
When picking a data structure to use, you must consider:
- the type of data being stored
- the cost of the most common operations you will perform on that data
- memory usage
- ease of implementation

### Applications of Trees
- store hierarchical data
- organize data for quick search, insertion, deletion (binary search trees)
- Tries
- network routing algorithms
