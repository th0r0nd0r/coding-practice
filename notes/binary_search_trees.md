# Binary Search Trees

### What are they?
- a binary tree in which for each node, the values of all nodes in the left subtree are lesser than the values in all nodes of the right subtree

### Why use them?

- consider the cost of common operations on these different data structures:

#### Array (unsorted)
- search: O(n)
- insertion (at end, or beginning with ring buffer): O(1)
- deletion: O(n)

#### Linked List
- search: O(n)
- insertion: O(1)
- deletion: O(n)
- note: linked lists have O(1) insertion/deletion if you're already at the location you want to add/delete at via a pointer.

#### Array (sorted)
- search: O(log(n)) (with binary search)
- insertion: O(n) (have to keep it sorted)
- deletion: O(n)

#### Binary Search Tree (balanced)
- search: O(log(n))
- insertion: O(log(n))
- deletion: O(log(n))
- note: these are average cases.  Worst case for all ops in O(n) for an unbalanced tree.
