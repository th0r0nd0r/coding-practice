# Study Topics

### First Pass
- Trees
  + binary
  + BST
  + DFS
  + add/delete nodes

- Linked Lists
  + merge k sorted lists
  + make list/node classes
  + use in hash map

- Heaps
  + BinaryMin/Max Heap
  + heap sort

- Stacks

- Queues
  + queue from two stacks

- Hash Tables
  + implement with arrays/linked lists


### Further Review
- Trees
  + add/delete nodes
  + more algo practice

- more Stack/Queue problems

- Heaps/heap sort

- Hash Tables
  + get really fast at making w/ only arrays in JS

### To Study
- Sorting
  + Quicksort
  + Mergesort
  + know when to use each

- Trees
  + n-ary
  + trie
  + balanced binary tree (at least one)
    - red/black
    - splay
    - AVL

- Graphs
  + know the 3 representations
    - objects/pointers
    - matrix
    - adjacency list
  + basic traversal algos (computational complexity, tradeoffs and implementation):
    - BFS
    - DFS
